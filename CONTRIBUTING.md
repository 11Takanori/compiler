# Contributing to Elm

Thanks helping with the development of Elm! **Here's how you can help.**

## Opening a PR

The master branch of Elm is used for tagging releases, and the dev branch is
where the most active development occurs.

**Please open PRs against the [dev branch of
Elm](http://github.com/evancz/elm/tree/dev) whenever possible.** Changes that
are compatible with the API of master will be merged to master as soon as
possible. Changes that affect Elm's API will be merged to master with a future
release of the compiler.

Note that changes in the master branch of [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/Elm/)
are able to be compiled against the master branch of the [elm-lang.org
repo](https://github.com/evancz/elm-lang.org), and the dev branch of
[Elm](https://github.com/evancz/Elm/) is able to be built with the dev branch of
the [elm-lang.org repo](https://github.com/evancz/elm-lang.org). Please make
sure that your changes maintain this compatibility.
